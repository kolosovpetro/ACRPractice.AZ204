[![Run Build and Test](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/ACRPractice.AZ204/actions/workflows/run-build-and-test-dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/ACRPractice.AZ204/actions/workflows/run-build-and-test-dotnet.yml)

Well, yet another practice today, this time we fight against Azure Container registry.
The scope of current kata is to reach the deep understanding of how to build, push and deploy containerized apps to the
azure container registry and container instances.
So, the following to be done:

- Create `DockerFile` and describe its steps in details
- Build `DockerFile` locally with appropriate tag*s
- Create `Azure container registry` using CLI
- Push image to the `ACR` using appropriate authorization
- Deploy image to the `Azure container instances`
